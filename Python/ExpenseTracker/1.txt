I applied my Python skills to build a simple Expense Tracker application using the tkinter library for the GUI and basic file handling for data storage. The project allows users to input daily expenses including date, category, amount, and description, and saves this data into a CSV file. This helped me practice real-world Python concepts like functions, file operations, and user interface design. Through this project, I learned how to create interactive applications, handle user input efficiently, and manage data in a structured format, showcasing my ability to apply coding skills to practical tasks.
